This lesson is an introduction to the workflow manager Nextflow, and nf-core, a community effort to collect a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow.

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers such as Docker and Singularity. It allows the adaptation of pipelines written in the most common scripting languages such as R and Python. Nextflow is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that simplifies the implementation and the deployment of complex parallel and reactive workflows on clouds and clusters.

This lesson also introduces [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/): a framework that provides a community-driven, peer reviewed platform for the development of best practice analysis pipelines written in Nextflow.

This lesson motivates the use of Nextflow and nf-core as a development tool for building and sharing computational pipelines that facilitate reproducible (data) science workflows.
