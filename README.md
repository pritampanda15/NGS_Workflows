The `NGS_Workflows` repository, is a collection of workflows and scripts designed for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis. It encompasses various tools and pipelines to facilitate the processing and interpretation of NGS data.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each focusing on different aspects of NGS data analysis:

- **Fastq-manipulation-in-R-main**: Contains R scripts for handling and processing FASTQ files, which are commonly used in NGS data.

- **Nextflow**: Includes workflows developed using Nextflow, a workflow management system that enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows.

- **Pathway-Analysis-Tool-main**: Offers tools for conducting pathway analysis, aiding in the interpretation of biological pathways from NGS data.

- **RNASeq-DESEq2-main**: Provides scripts and workflows for RNA-Seq data analysis using DESeq2, a tool for differential gene expression analysis.

- **Single_Cell**: Contains resources and workflows tailored for single-cell sequencing data analysis.

- **Snakemake-Workflow-Template-master**: Offers templates for creating workflows using Snakemake, a workflow management system that simplifies the creation of complex data analysis pipelines.

- **Spatial_Transcriptomics-main**: Includes tools and scripts for spatial transcriptomics, a technique that combines spatial information with gene expression data.

- **WholeExomeSequencing-Pipeline-main**: Provides a pipeline for whole-exome sequencing data analysis, facilitating the identification of genetic variants.

- **shraq-main**: Contains additional scripts and tools related to NGS data analysis.
